The Minimum Viable Data Space Infrastructure as a Service (MVDS-IaaS) is a set of components that are necessary to deploy a Data Space. The MVDS-IaaS is based on the [FIWARE](https://www.fiware.org/) ecosystem and is designed to be deployed on top of a Kubernetes cluster. The MVDS-IaaS is composed of the following components:

- Data Space Operator (*Trusted Issuers Registry*)
- Data Space Marketplace (*only on the [DSBA-compliant demo](https://github.com/FIWARE-Ops/data-space-connector)*)
- [FIWARE Data Space Connector](https://github.com/FIWARE-Ops/data-space-connector)

## On premise/Local deployment

The MVDS-IaaS can be deployed on a local/cloud/on-premise machine using [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/). The objective is provide an autonomous environment to test the components of the Data Space with the minimum cost and complexity possible.

### Environment setup

The environment is composed of a Kubernetes cluster created with kind, with one master node and two worker nodes. Also installed:

- [Ingress Nginx Controller](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/ingress/#ingress-nginx)

- [Load Balancer](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/loadbalancer/#installing-metallb-using-default-manifests)

### Data Space Operator

The Dataspace Operator acts as the TrustAnchor of the Data Space. It provides the particpants information on whom to trust.

#### DSBA-compliant demo

The DSBA-compliant demo architecture for the Data Space Operator is composed of the following components:

Also some services need external access, so the Ingress Nginx Controller is configured.
