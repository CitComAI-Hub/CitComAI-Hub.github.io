Citcom.ai is a project **open to the European society, allowing any interested company or institution to join this ecosystem**. Citcom.ai's **core technology is data spaces**, which guarantee completely secure environments for data exchange.  

## What data are available?
There are multiple data spaces grouping different institutions (e.g. cities, companies, etc.) at local, national or European Union level. Depending on each data space, the available data may vary.

## How can I join a data space? 
Basically, you **need to deploy a data space connector** and **request certified access** to the data space trust anchor manager.  

The process of joining an existing data space will be outlined, including details on membership requirements, access controls, and collaboration tools within that environment. 

In addition, access to a data space does not have to be only as a **consumer** of data, but you can also access it as a **provider**. Depending on the **role** you want to play in the data space, the way you join may vary.
