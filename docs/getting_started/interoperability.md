# Interoperability
Interoperability is a key aspect of CitCom.ai’s approach to ensuring that data can be securely and effectively shared across different systems and organizations. 

## IDSA Documentation

- **Key Layers:**  
  The IDS documentation emphasizes four primary layers—**technical**, **semantic**, **organizational**, and **legal**—that collectively underpin effective interoperability.

- **Intra Data Space Interoperability:**  
  Within a single Data Space, a unified governance framework ensures that all participants adhere to the same protocols and models.

- **Cross-Data Space Interoperability:**  
  When operating across multiple Data Spaces, additional coordination is required to bridge varying protocols and legal frameworks.

For a comprehensive explanation and additional context, please refer to the original [IDS documentation on Interoperability in Data Spaces](https://docs.internationaldataspaces.org/ids-knowledgebase/idsa-rulebook/idsa-rulebook/3_interoperability).

## MIMs
[MIMs](https://mims.oascities.org/) stands for "Minimal Interoperability Mechanisms". These guidelines and standards were developed by the [Open & Agile Smart Cities (OASC)](https://oascities.org/) initiative to promote **interoperability** among different city systems and technologies, such as traffic management systems, waste management systems, and energy distribution systems. CitCom.ai project **embraces minimal interoperability mechanisms (MIMs)** as part of its approach.
