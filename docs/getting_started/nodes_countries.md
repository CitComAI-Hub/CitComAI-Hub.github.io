# Nodes & Countries

The CitCom.ai project is organized into a **network** of specialized testing sites known as **nodes**. These nodes are strategically distributed across different locations to cover a wide range of environments and use cases. The project is divided into three main __*super nodes*__, each with its own focus areas and satellite sub-nodes.

- **Nordic Node**: Focuses on innovations in **energy** management and sustainability, leveraging the expertise and infrastructure available in Northern Europe.
- **Central Node**: Located in the heart of Europe, this node emphasizes urban **mobility** and smart city solutions, testing technologies like autonomous vehicles and smart traffic systems.
- **Southern Node**: This node concentrates on **connectivity** and telecommunications, ensuring robust and scalable solutions for both urban and rural settings.
