title: Trust Frameworks
---

A _trust framework_ is a set of policies, principles, and mechanisms that establish and maintain trust among participants in a data space ecosystem. It outlines the rules and agreements that govern how data is accessed, used, and shared, ensuring security, transparency, compliance with regulations, and ethical use. It often includes aspects like identity verification, access control, data protection, and mutual agreements between entities to facilitate trustworthy collaboration.

> Every Data Spaces requires a framework that ensures trust between the participants. Depending on the requirements of the concrete Data Space, this can become a rather complex topic. Various trust-providers exist( f.e. Gaia-X Digital Clearing Houses) and could be reused([see Gaia-X for more information](https://github.com/FIWARE/data-space-connector/blob/main/doc/GAIA_X.MD)).
