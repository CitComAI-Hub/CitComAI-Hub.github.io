# Welcome

Welcome to VRAIN documentation for the [Citcom.AI](https://citcom.ai) project. On the following site, you will find different guides and resources.

## About the project

[Citcom.AI](https://citcom.ai) is one of the [Testing and Experimentation Facilities (TEFs)](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/testing-and-experimentation-facilities), which are specialized sites for testing *state-of-the-art* AI and robotics solutions. These facilities are open to all European technology providers and provide technical support to innovators, allowing them to test both software and hardware AI products at scale (Technology Readiness Levels 6-8).

### Nodes & Countries

The Citcom.AI project is organized into a network of specialized testing sites known as **nodes**. These nodes are strategically distributed across different locations to cover a wide range of environments and use cases. The project is divided into three main __*super nodes*__, each with its own focus areas and satellite sub-nodes.

- **Nordic Node**: Focuses on innovations in **energy** management and sustainability, leveraging the expertise and infrastructure available in Northern Europe.
- **Central Node**: Located in the heart of Europe, this node emphasizes urban **mobility** and smart city solutions, testing technologies like autonomous vehicles and smart traffic systems.
- **Southern Node**: This node concentrates on **connectivity** and telecommunications, ensuring robust and scalable solutions for both urban and rural settings.

|           | The Nordic Super Node | The Central Super Node | The Southern Super Node |
| -:        | :-------------------: | :--------------------: | :---------------------: |
| *Focus Area* | POWER              | MOVE                   | CONNECT                   |
| *Lead*    | Denmark               | Belgium                | Spain                   |
| *Members* | Sweden, Finland       | France, Luxembourg, The Netherlands | Italy, Poland, Germany |

### Interoperability & MIMs
[MIMs](https://mims.oascities.org/) stands for "Minimal Interoperability Mechanisms." These guidelines and standards were developed by the Open & Agile Smart Cities (OASC) initiative to promote interoperability among different city systems and technologies, such as traffic management systems, waste management systems, and energy distribution systems. The idea is to ensure that data, systems, and services can be shared and used across various platforms without vendor lock-in, enabling a more cohesive and collaborative global marketplace for smart city solutions. MIMs address scenarios like integrating these different technologies, accessing data from various sources, and building interoperable solutions​.

CitCom.AI project embraces minimal interoperability mechanisms (MIMs) as part of its approach. MIMs are crucial for ensuring interoperability and standardization within smart city solutions, a vital focus of the Open & Agile Smart Cities (OASC) initiative. The CitCom.AI project is aligned with these principles, as it aims to develop AI-driven tools that are interoperable, transparent, and secure across different urban contexts.

In particular, MIMs help create a common framework for AI applications, data management, and public administration tools, ensuring that these systems can work together seamlessly across different cities and regions. This alignment with MIMs ensures that the AI tools developed under the CitCom.AI project are not only practical but also scalable and adaptable to various local needs​
