## About CitCom.ai
The [CitCom.ai](https://citcom.ai) project is an ambitious **European Union initiative** aimed at establishing a comprehensive [Testing and Experimentation Facilities (TEFs)](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/testing-and-experimentation-facilities) for **AI and robotics**, tailored explicitly to **smart and sustainable cities and communities**. This project is designed to accelerate the adoption of AI technologies across Europe by providing real-world testing environments where companies can develop, test, and validate their AI-driven products and services. CitCom ensures that these technologies meet the latest EU regulations, including those related to data **privacy and cybersecurity** while supporting the creation of **interoperable** and ethically sound AI solutions. The project spans multiple countries, with over 50 participating organizations, and it emphasizes a coordinated approach to fostering innovation that aligns with the EU’s goals for a greener and more digital future.

The initiative is particularly valuable for companies looking to understand and comply with new EU laws surrounding AI, providing them with technical support, access to high-performance computing, digital twins, and other advanced tools. It also serves as a resource for public organizations to learn about and procure innovative AI solutions.
