# Welcome

Welcome to VRAIN documentation for the [Citcom.AI](https://citcom.ai) project. On the following site, you will find different guides and resources.

## About the project

[Citcom.AI](https://citcom.ai) is one of the [Testing and Experimentation Facilities (TEFs)](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/testing-and-experimentation-facilities), which are specialized sites for testing *state-of-the-art* AI and robotics solutions. These facilities are open to all European technology providers and provide technical support to innovators, allowing them to test both software and hardware AI products at scale (Technology Readiness Levels 6-8).

### Nodes & Countries

The Citcom.AI project is organized into a network of specialized testing sites known as **nodes**. These nodes are strategically distributed across different locations to cover a wide range of environments and use cases. The project is divided into three main __*super nodes*__, each with its own focus areas and satellite sub-nodes.

- **Nordic Node**: Focuses on innovations in **energy** management and sustainability, leveraging the expertise and infrastructure available in Northern Europe.
- **Central Node**: Located in the heart of Europe, this node emphasizes urban **mobility** and smart city solutions, testing technologies like autonomous vehicles and smart traffic systems.
- **Southern Node**: This node concentrates on **connectivity** and telecommunications, ensuring robust and scalable solutions for both urban and rural settings.

|           | The Nordic Super Node | The Central Super Node | The Southern Super Node |
| -:        | :-------------------: | :--------------------: | :---------------------: |
| *Focus Area* | POWER              | MOVE                   | CONNECT                   |
| *Lead*    | Denmark               | Belgium                | Spain                   |
| *Members* | Sweden, Finland       | France, Luxembourg, The Netherlands | Italy, Poland, Germany |
