Welcome to the VRAIN documentation for the Citcom.ai project. On the following site you will find different guides and resources related to the project.

## About the project
The [Citcom.ai](https://citcom.ai) project is an ambitious **European Union initiative** aimed at establishing a comprehensive [Testing and Experimentation Facilities (TEFs)](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/testing-and-experimentation-facilities) for **AI and robotics**, tailored explicitly to **smart and sustainable cities and communities**. This project is designed to accelerate the adoption of AI technologies across Europe by providing real-world testing environments where companies can develop, test, and validate their AI-driven products and services. CitCom ensures that these technologies meet the latest EU regulations, including those related to data **privacy and cybersecurity** while supporting the creation of **interoperable** and ethically sound AI solutions. The project spans multiple countries, with over 50 participating organizations, and it emphasizes a coordinated approach to fostering innovation that aligns with the EU’s goals for a greener and more digital future.

The initiative is particularly valuable for companies looking to understand and comply with new EU laws surrounding AI, providing them with technical support, access to high-performance computing, digital twins, and other advanced tools. It also serves as a resource for public organizations to learn about and procure innovative AI solutions.

### Nodes & Countries
The Citcom.ai project is organized into a **network** of specialized testing sites known as **nodes**. These nodes are strategically distributed across different locations to cover a wide range of environments and use cases. The project is divided into three main __*super nodes*__, each with its own focus areas and satellite sub-nodes.

- **Nordic Node**: Focuses on innovations in **energy** management and sustainability, leveraging the expertise and infrastructure available in Northern Europe.
- **Central Node**: Located in the heart of Europe, this node emphasizes urban **mobility** and smart city solutions, testing technologies like autonomous vehicles and smart traffic systems.
- **Southern Node**: This node concentrates on **connectivity** and telecommunications, ensuring robust and scalable solutions for both urban and rural settings.

|           | The Nordic Super Node | The Central Super Node | The Southern Super Node |
| -:        | :-------------------: | :--------------------: | :---------------------: |
| *Focus Area* | POWER              | MOVE                   | CONNECT                   |
| *Lead*    | Denmark               | Belgium                | Spain                   |
| *Members* | Denmark, Sweden, Finland       | Belgium, France, Luxembourg, The Netherlands | Spain, Italy, Poland, Germany |

### Interoperability & MIMs
[MIMs](https://mims.oascities.org/) stands for "Minimal Interoperability Mechanisms." These guidelines and standards were developed by the [Open & Agile Smart Cities (OASC)](https://oascities.org/) initiative to promote **interoperability** among different city systems and technologies, such as traffic management systems, waste management systems, and energy distribution systems. The idea is to ensure that data, systems, and services can be shared and used across various platforms without vendor lock-in, enabling a more cohesive and collaborative global marketplace for smart city solutions. MIMs address scenarios like integrating these different technologies, accessing data from various sources, and building interoperable solutions​.

CitCom.ai project **embraces minimal interoperability mechanisms (MIMs)** as part of its approach. MIMs are crucial for ensuring interoperability and standardization within smart city solutions, a vital focus of the [Open & Agile Smart Cities (OASC)](https://oascities.org/) initiative. The CitCom.AI **project is aligned with these principles**, as it aims to develop AI-driven tools that are interoperable, transparent, and secure across different urban contexts.

In particular, MIMs help create a common framework for AI applications, data management, and public administration tools, ensuring that these systems can work together seamlessly across different cities and regions. This alignment with MIMs ensures that the AI tools developed under the CitCom.AI project are not only practical but also scalable and adaptable to various local needs​.

### Data spaces
Data spaces refer to structured and managed environments where data from various sources is securely stored, shared, and utilized for AI and robotics applications within smart and sustainable cities. These **data spaces are the project's core technology**, enabling participants to **access** and leverage **high-quality data for testing, experimentation, and validation of AI technologies**.

Data spaces support **interoperability**, ensuring that data from different sources can be combined and used while **complying with regulations** such as the GDPR and other EU directives. They provide the necessary infrastructure for managing data in a way that supports ethical considerations, cybersecurity, and the broader goals of creating a more digital and sustainable urban environment.

In Citcom.ai, data spaces are pivotal in accelerating innovation by facilitating collaboration among different stakeholders. They offer a **secure** and compliant framework for data exchange, ensuring that the **AI solutions developed within the project are both reliable and aligned with European standards**. This emphasis on innovation and the potential for significant progress is sure to excite the audience.

## How to join the Citcom.ai ecosystem? 
Citcom.ai is a project **open to the European society, allowing any interested company or institution to join this ecosystem**. Citcom.ai's **core technology is data spaces**, which guarantee completely secure environments for data exchange.  

### What data are available?
There are multiple data spaces grouping different institutions (e.g. cities, companies, etc.) at local, national or European Union level. Depending on each data space, the available data may vary.

### How can I join a data space? 
Basically, you **need to deploy a data space connector** and **request certified access** to the data space trust anchor manager.  

The process of joining an existing data space will be outlined, including details on membership requirements, access controls, and collaboration tools within that environment. 

In addition, access to a data space does not have to be only as a **consumer** of data, but you can also access it as a **provider**. Depending on the **role** you want to play in the data space, the way you join may vary.
